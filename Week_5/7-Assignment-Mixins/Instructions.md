# Assignment: Mixins

- [x] Create a new branch and switch to it.

- [x] Create a new file called mixins.rb.

- [ ] Define the 3 new modules in mixins.rb.

- [ ] In your original classes file, add the line require_relative 'mixins'. This will tell Ruby where the modules can be found.

- [ ] Add 1 or more modules to each of your classes.

- [ ] Create a new file called main.rb.

- [ ] Inside of main.rb add the line require_relative 'name_of_your_classes_file'.

- [ ] Remove all of the functional code from your classes file and put it in main.rb.

- [ ] Add new code to demonstrate the new functionality defined in the modules. At this point your classes file should contain the code that defines the classes and nothing else. All code that calls the methods and runs the program should be in main.rb.

- [ ] Run ruby main.rb to ensure it runs as expected.

- [ ] Push to GitHub. Don't forget to add the new files to your commits!

- [ ] Create a PR and submit in Canvas.
