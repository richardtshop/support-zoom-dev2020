# 1. Names of test classes should mimic the Ruby class by <ruby class name>_test.rb
#
# 2. Typically when you have many small classes in a single file its a code
# smell that you probably want to move them to different files. The benefits
# are that constant loading is more straightforward, and testing is easier and
# more explicit
#
# 3. Lots of these arguments are positional in nature. Meaning, the caller
# doesn't really know unless they read the method prototype or documentation
# what exactly these arguments should be, datatype or even data. This would be
# a good case to use keyword arguments.
#
# 4. Lots of the methods, like the methods in LegoMiniFigure class should be
# private. They are an implementation concern that only helps the public
# methods do work more easily. Keeping methods explicit as private or protected
# allows you to keep the guts of the class hidden from the public.
# Additionally, if you decide to change implementation details but not the
# public API you won't need to update tests
#
# 5. Generally you don't see custom to_s implementations in the wild. However,
# its completely fine to do so. For example, lets say you exposed a library
# that calling `to_s` on the result returned out some normalized result.
#
# 6. Testing should save you money. That's the whole point. It seems tedious
# now, but imagine you're working in a codebase with hundreds of other
# developers that is tens of thousands of lines large. Testing helps us by
# having computers check implementations are correct instead of humans.
#
# Lots of people really dislike testing, you'll often hear that tests might be
# slow, fragile (ie; will break if you change the implementation often).
# They're expensive, etc. It's absolutely possible to have cost effective tests.
#
# 7. Unit tests should be _few_. We want the code for the tests to be the most
# apt expression of how to interact with your code. We don't want extra lines
# of unnecessary test code.
#
# 8. As a rule of thumb, avoid `and` or `or` keywords in Ruby. Most of the time
# these are footguns. `||` has a higher precedence than `or`. A common example
# of this is:
#
#   a = false || true  #=> true
#   a  #=> true
#   a = false or true  #=> true
#   a  #=> false
#
# 9. Sometimes its difficult to find the balance of too few and too many tests.
# Ultimately, unit tests add a cost. It's about finding the right balance of
# too much and too little testing.
