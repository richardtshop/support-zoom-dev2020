# Test-Driven Development

## The TDD Process

When writing our code, we will be following the following process:

1. Write a test for a single functionality
2. Make sure the test fails
3. Write the simplest code that should satisfy the test
4. Make sure the test passes
5. Refactor, if needed
6. Make sure all tests still pass
7. Repeat

### ASCII Art

Take a look at [ASCII Art (Revisited)](</ASCII%20Art%20(Revisited).md>). Work with your partner to re-solve this problem that we first saw way back in Module 1.

You will need to design your code using TDD. To help with testing your code, be sure to create an `AsciiArt` class with a `draw(number)` method that returns a string that is correctly formatted so that it could be used with `puts` to draw the desired shape.

Be sure to commit your code after each test that you add.

## Reflection

At the end of the tutorial, answer the following questions in the textbox in Canvas:

- How did it feel to write tests first?

- Did writing tests first affect the way your code turned out? How?

- Is TDD something you think you'll use in your work in the future?
